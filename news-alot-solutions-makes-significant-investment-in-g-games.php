                <p>ALOT Solutions has today announced that it has made a significant equity investment in <a href="https://g.games/" target="_blank">G&nbsp;Games</a> (formerly called Gamevy) - a leading game design and development company that ‘puts fun at the heart of real-money games’ for state and private lotteries around the world, as well as online casinos and sportsbooks. G Games will continue to operate independently.</p>
                <p>This investment further enhances ALOT Solutions’ offering of Prize Cover, Technology and Content as the business continues to expand. It will also enable ALOT Solutions and G Games to further collaborate on ad-hoc strategic opportunities such as lottery tenders.</p>
                <p>Paul Dolman-Darrall, CEO of G Games commented: “I am pleased to have ALOT Solutions on board as an investor. I believe the relationship will help both businesses expand and explore new and exciting opportunities. Over the last few years we have grown our lottery client base significantly and are now working with Sisal in Italy and Morocco; Milli Piyango; Latvijas Loto; Norsk Tipping; Lottomatica; Snai; and Danske Spil among others.”</p>
                <p>ALOT Solutions CEO Michael Carruthers commented: “This is another significant investment for ALOT Solutions in a class-leading B2B lottery supplier. I am very impressed by G Games’ lottery content and the reach they have in the industry and I look forward to working more closely with them over the coming months and years. This investment will help us to grow faster as we power innovation in the lottery, gaming and prize promotion sectors to benefit players, operators and their good causes.”</p>
